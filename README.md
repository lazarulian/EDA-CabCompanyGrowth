### Exploratory Data Analysis Notebook for Cab Data ###
**IMPORTANT, because I used Plotly (interactive graphing) for my graphing engine, you will need to run the document to see the resulting graphs***

# EDA-CabCompanyGrowth
 Exploratory data analysis conducted as a preliminary step for building a model for public Cab Company data.
 
## Initial Questions to be Tested
* Which cab company has a larger profit margin?
* Which cab company has a more signficant userbase in specific critical cities?
* Does the cab company implicitly use better metrics for specific factors such as sex, age, etc.
* Does each cab company operate evenly throughout the year? 
* Does one cab company cater to a particular demographic compared to another?

## Recommendations
* Profit margin for Yellow Cab is significantly larger than that of pink cab
* Yellow Cab has the largest market share in NYC which has the largest customer base in the cities listed
* Yellow Cab has a more expensive pricing model based off of KM travelled increasing their margins and thus increasing profit.
* Yellow cab makes more profit per/capita than pink cab.
* Yellow Cab makes more than double the revenue of pink cab

**Thus, yellow cab is recommended for investment**
